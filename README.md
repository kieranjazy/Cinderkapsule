# Cinderkapsule
Custom C++ real-time engine using SDL2, Vulkan, and FMod.
Most of the work has been done on the Vulkan implementation.

Project is being refactored entirely to be up to a more modern C++ standard and to be more efficient.

https://github.com/kieranjazy/Cinderkapsule2 is rewrite of this.

Final release shows of custom camera code, early movement code, support for multiple objects, support for rendering multiple texture maps on objects, rudimentary PBR implementation.
